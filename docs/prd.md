## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a tic tac toe game implemented using pygame. It should have a user-friendly interface and support both single-player and two-player modes. The game should display the current state of the game and the winner. It should also allow the players to restart the game after it ends.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Implement the tic tac toe game logic", "P0"),
    ("Create the game interface using pygame", "P0"),
    ("Implement the single-player mode with intelligent AI", "P1"),
    ("Implement the two-player mode", "P1"),
    ("Display the current state of the game and the winner", "P2")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The game interface should have a 3x3 grid representing the tic tac toe board. Each cell of the grid should be clickable and display the player's symbol (X or O) when clicked. The current state of the game and the winner should be displayed at the top of the interface. There should be a "New Game" button to start a new game and a "Restart" button to restart the game after it ends. The interface should have a clean and modern design with visually appealing graphics and animations.
